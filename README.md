# BÃ¤ttre Nyheter

A chrome extension for improving the websites of popular Swedish news websites.
 
## Introduction
This chrome extension can filter clickbait and subscription articles from the following websites:

 - Aftonbladet.se

(WIP):

 - Expressen.se
 - More (?) from request

It does this by using [Bayes Classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_classifier), which classifies the headlines and paragraphs. The classifier has been trained with a dataset of articles that **I** consider to be clickbait. 

## Motivation
I got tired of browsing Swedish news sites because of the ever increasing amount of clickbait articles on these sites, and to battle this new era of "reporting" I wrote this chrome-extension

## Coming Features

 - Custom filters (You don't follow Idol? Or don't care for Paradise Hotel?)
 - List of the articles filtered and why
 - Restore article to the frontpage

## Contribution

Pull requests are welcome!

## Disclaimer
I cannot guarantee that every clickbait article will be filtered, and there may be some false positives. This will hopefully get more stable with time as the dataset of articles will become larger as I, or contributors, add them.
